# Rui Diao's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, built to share my journey as an indie creator after a decade at Google. The website showcases my writings, projects, and thoughts on technology and life.

## About Me

After a decade as a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google, I'm now an indie creator focused on building a life centered around freedom, curiosity, and craft. This website is a living document of that journey.
